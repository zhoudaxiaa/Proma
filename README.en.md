# Proma

Proma is a local-first AI desktop app that brings multi-model Chat, general-purpose Agent workflows, workspaces, Skills, MCP, remote bots, and memory into one open-source client.

It is not just another chat box. Proma is meant to become a long-lived Agent workbench for your personal workflows: use Chat for simple answers, use Agent when the task needs to act on files, tools, projects, and longer context.

## What Proma Can Do

- **Chat mode**: multi-model conversations, attachments, image input, Markdown / Mermaid / KaTeX / code highlighting, parallel conversations, system prompts, and context controls.
- **Agent mode**: general-purpose Agent powered by `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, with workspace isolation, permission modes, file operations, streaming output, plan confirmation, and ask-user interactions.
- **SubAgents / Tasks**: complex tasks can be delegated through the Claude Agent SDK Agent tool, with sub-agent calls and results shown in the message stream.
- **Skills & MCP**: each workspace can manage its own Skills, MCP servers, and workspace files.
- **Remote bots**: Lark / Feishu bot bridging is supported, with DingTalk and WeChat bridge entry points also present in the app.
- **Memory and tools**: Chat and Agent can share memory, with web search, built-in Chat tools, and Agent recommendation helpers.
- **Local-first data**: conversations, workspaces, attachments, settings, and Skills are stored under `~/.proma/` as JSON / JSONL files, without a local database.
- **Desktop experience**: auto-update, proxy settings, file preview, global shortcuts, quick task window, voice input, and light / dark / system themes.

## Getting Started

### Download

Download the open-source version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ErlichLiu/Proma/releases). The current release notes are for `v0.9.12`, with builds for macOS Apple Silicon, macOS Intel, and Windows.

If you want fewer API setup steps, you can also use the [Proma commercial version](https://proma.cool/download). The commercial and open-source versions run in parallel; the commercial version mainly adds built-in model channels and subscription options.

### First Setup

1. Open Proma and finish the environment check. Agent mode depends on local tooling, especially Git, Node.js / Bun, and a usable shell.
2. Go to **Settings > Channels**, add at least one AI provider channel, and fill in Base URL, API Key, and model list.
3. Chat mode can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI-compatible channels.
4. Agent mode requires an Anthropic or Anthropic-compatible channel, such as Anthropic, DeepSeek, Kimi API, or Kimi Coding Plan.
5. Go to **Settings > Agent** and choose the default Agent channel, model, and workspace.
6. Configure memory, web search, or Feishu / DingTalk / WeChat bridges from their corresponding settings tabs if needed.

## Choosing A Mode

### Use Chat For

- Everyday Q&A, explanation, translation, rewriting, and lightweight code discussion.
- Reading attachments and summarizing or comparing their content.
- One-off conversations enhanced by web search or memory tools.
- Comparing outputs from multiple models or exploring different system prompts.

### Use Agent For

- Creating, editing, or organizing local files.
- Research, report writing, and multi-step tasks.
- Work that needs MCP, Skills, Shell, Git, project files, or external context.
- Tasks that benefit from permissions, plan mode, background execution, or remote bot follow-up.

In short: **use Chat when you need an answer; use Agent when you need work to be done.**

## Screenshots

### Chat Analysis

Use Chat for lightweight but practical analysis: compare audience needs, generate a table, and shape first-screen README copy quickly.

### Agent Workbench

Agent works inside a workspace, reads project files, progresses through tasks, outputs structured findings, and keeps reusable files visible in the right-side workspace panel.

![Proma Agent workbench](./docs/assets/screenshots/proma-agent-demo.png)

### Skills

Each workspace can keep its own reusable Skills. The `feedback-synthesis` Skill shown here turns scattered feedback, interviews, and issues into themes, evidence, and priority suggestions.

### Skills & MCP

The same workspace can manage stdio and HTTP MCP servers, enabling or disabling external context per project.

### Streaming Voice Input

Proma supports Doubao-powered streaming voice input, both inside Proma and across the desktop:

- Inside Proma: press Ctrl + Backtick to start recognition, then press it again to finish and insert the transcript into the active Proma input box.
- Outside Proma: press Ctrl + Backtick to start recognition, then press it again to finish and insert the transcript at the current cursor position. If there is no active cursor, Proma writes the transcript to the clipboard.

> **Kimi Coding Plan users**: Proma is officially whitelisted by Kimi. Using Proma with your Kimi Coding Plan subscription will not trigger any third-party client ban policy.

Agent mode is powered by Claude Agent SDK, so it currently requires an Anthropic or Anthropic-compatible channel. Chat mode uses Provider Adapters from `@proma/core` to support different protocols.

## Local Data

Proma stores data in local files so it is easy to back up, migrate, and inspect.

```text
~/.proma/
├── channels.json
├── conversations.json
├── conversations/
│   └── {conversation-id}.jsonl
├── agent-sessions.json
├── agent-sessions/
│   └── {session-id}.jsonl
├── agent-workspaces/
│   └── {workspace-slug}/
│       ├── workspace-files/
│       ├── mcp.json
│       └── skills/
├── attachments/
├── user-profile.json
├── settings.json
└── sdk-config/
```

API keys are encrypted through Electron `safeStorage` before being written to `channels.json`. Proma does not use a local database; core data is represented as JSON configuration and append-only JSONL logs.

## Development

Proma is a Bun workspace monorepo.

## Architecture

Proma's core communication path is:

```text
shared types and IPC constants
  -> main/ipc.ts handlers
  -> preload/index.ts window.electronAPI bridge
  -> renderer Jotai atoms and React components
```

Main-process services live in `apps/electron/src/main/lib/`:

- `agent-orchestrator.ts`: Agent orchestration, environment variables, SDK calls, event streams, error handling.
- `agent-session-manager.ts`: Agent session index and JSONL message persistence.
- `agent-workspace-manager.ts`: workspaces, MCP, Skills, and workspace files.
- `chat-service.ts`: Chat streaming, Provider Adapters, tool activity.
- `conversation-manager.ts`: Chat session index and message storage.
- `channel-manager.ts`: channel CRUD, API key encryption, connection tests, model fetching.
- `feishu-bridge.ts` / `dingtalk-bridge.ts` / `wechat-bridge.ts`: remote bot bridges.
- `memory-service.ts`, `chat-tool-*`, `document-parser.ts`, `workspace-watcher.ts`: memory, tools, document parsing, and file watching.

Renderer state is managed with Jotai. Key atoms live in `apps/electron/src/renderer/atoms/`. Agent IPC listeners are mounted globally at the app root so streaming events, permission requests, and background tasks survive view changes.

## Packaging Notes

`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` uses platform native binaries since `0.2.113+`. Proma marks the SDK as external in esbuild and includes the SDK main package plus platform subpackages in `electron-builder.yml`.

When changing packaging configuration, make sure:

- Main-process esbuild keeps `--external:@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
- `apps/electron/package.json` includes target SDK platform subpackages in `optionalDependencies`.
- `apps/electron/electron-builder.yml` includes the SDK main package and platform subpackages in `files`.
- Ordinary npm dependencies should usually be bundled into `main.cjs` by esbuild instead of being marked external.

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the full engineering conventions.

## Contributing

Bug fixes, documentation improvements, tests, UX polish, Skills, MCP configs, and real-world Agent workflows are all welcome.

Before opening a PR, please check:

- Use Bun scripts and do not mix npm / pnpm lockfiles.
- Use Jotai for state management.
- Keep the app local-first and prefer config files plus JSON / JSONL storage.
- Do not use TypeScript `any`; prefer `interface` for object shapes.
- When adding IPC, update shared types, main handler, preload bridge, and renderer calls together.
- Bump the patch version of affected packages when behavior changes.
- Add focused tests where possible, especially for shared logic, IPC contracts, and persistence formats.
